// Segment-scoped color functions: the seam between rich-js's palette-free
// color vocabulary and cc-candybar's notion of a segment.
//
// rich-js owns every color operation and knows nothing about segments;
// cc-candybar owns segments and performs no color arithmetic of its own
// [LAW:rich-js-owns-color-math]. This module is exactly the join: it supplies
// rich-js's `color` with *which* palette, and adds the one function whose
// meaning is candybar-specific — `bgOf`, the background of the segment
// currently rendering. [LAW:one-way-deps]

/**
 * Bind `color` and `bgOf` to the segment the walk has published.
 *
 * **Why `color` reads a live palette.** A segment's rendered palette is not a
 * property of the loaded config — it is the base theme (session choice over
 * config default) adapted by the render's look, resolved per render. Binding
 * `color` to a palette captured
 * when the config loaded put the *body* of a template on a different palette
 * than the `bg:`/`fg:` of the very same segment, so `{{ color "primary" }}`
 * and `bg: "primary"` could name one thing and paint two.
 * [LAW:one-source-of-truth]
 *
 * That divergence was not exotic. Any session theme click moved the segment's
 * background while leaving every in-body semantic color where it was; a look
 * did the same. Reading the live palette makes the two agree by construction
 * rather than by coincidence.
 *
 * **Why `bgOf` exists.** De-emphasis — drawing labels, punctuation and ids
 * quieter than the facts they frame — is "move this color toward the
 * background." A palette's own `foreground-muted` blends toward the *theme's*
 * background, which is the wrong target for any segment not painted in it: a
 * segment on `surface-active` needs its muted text blended toward
 * `surface-active`. Only the segment knows its own background, so only the
 * segment can supply it:
 *
 * ```
 * {{ $muted := mix (color "foreground") (bgOf) 65 }}
 * {{ fg $muted .git.repoName }} {{ fg (color "primary") .git.branch }}
 * ```
 *
 * This is also what makes contrast reachable: `{{ fg (contrastOn (bgOf)) … }}`
 * asks a question about a real background, where the old spec-grammar `"auto"`
 * could only ever be handed a hardcoded literal.
